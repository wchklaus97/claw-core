# Cross-Mode Referrals -- Claw Developer

When a task falls outside the developer scope, suggest the appropriate mode:

- **Pure Q&A (no code context needed)** -- suggest switching to `claw-assistant` mode
- **Architecture planning (big decisions)** -- suggest switching to `planner` mode
- **Feature with test-first approach** -- suggest switching to `tdd` mode
