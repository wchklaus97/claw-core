hero-chip-line1 = For Cursor Ultra
hero-chip-line2 = Pack Cursor agents into a multi-Claw workforce with OpenClaw integrations.
hero-description = Cursor Ultra usage does not remove model API cost. The agent brain still decides strategy and next steps, while Claw Core handles runtime execution and orchestration.
hero-highlight-sessions = Brain stays with Cursor
hero-highlight-workers = Claw runs the workforce
hero-highlight-cli = OpenClaw connects channels
hero-highlight-integrations = Mobile + long-running control
who-title = Who should use Claw Core
who-subtitle = Keep Cursor as the brain. Add Claw for execution at scale.
who-desc = If you already use Cursor Ultra, Claw Core adds the missing runtime layer: long-running workers, channel integrations, and reliable orchestration outside the IDE. Coding-agent skills remain your behavior layer; Claw Core is the execution layer.
who-card1 = You already rely on Cursor Ultra for agent intelligence
who-card2 = You need long-running worker pools outside the IDE
who-card3 = You want OpenClaw + Telegram/webhook end-to-end workflows
who-card4 = You need mobile and remote operational control
origin-title = Why this exists
origin-subtitle = Brain + runtime, not one layer
origin-desc = Skills and prompts define agent behavior, but they are not a production runtime. We built Claw Core because official CLI workflows need stronger execution control, concurrency, and cost visibility. With OpenClaw + Claw Core, Cursor remains the brain while a reliable workforce executes at scale.
origin-card1-title = Skills are not runtime infrastructure
origin-card1-desc = Coding-agent and other skills define behavior and playbooks; they do not replace process isolation, timeout policy, retries, and execution lifecycle control.
origin-card2-title = Official CLI needs an execution layer
origin-card2-desc = Many stacks do not fully support official Cursor CLI orchestration in long-running production flows. Claw Core fills that runtime gap.
origin-card3-title = Concurrent workers increase throughput
origin-card3-desc = Claw Core lets you run many sessions in parallel with structured output and cleanup, so your system stays fast and stable under heavy load.
origin-card4-title = OpenClaw + Claw Core = stronger operations
origin-card4-desc = OpenClaw orchestrates channels, skills, and workflow routing. Claw Core acts like the runtime workforce: execute, monitor, recover, and keep control like larger platform teams.
features-title = Features
features-subtitle = Session-managed execution for AI agents
features-sessions-title = Sessions
features-sessions-desc = Create, list, inspect, and destroy terminal sessions. Isolated working directories and env per session.
features-timeouts-title = Timeouts
features-timeouts-desc = Enforce per-command and per-session timeouts. No runaway processes; automatic cleanup.
features-api-title = JSON API
features-api-desc = Clean protocol over Unix socket or HTTP. Request/response with stdout, stderr, exit code.
features-secrets-title = Secrets
features-secrets-desc = Forward env vars to child processes. Never persist secrets to disk.
features-cli-title = Cursor CLI
features-cli-desc = Built for Cursor Ultra. Run cursor agent as workers in long-running pools. Keep coding-agent skills for agent behavior, and use Claw Core for execution/runtime control.
features-integrations-title = Integrations
features-integrations-desc = OpenClaw connects into the Claw Core runtime via plugin, then links Telegram, webhooks, and other channels for end-to-end control from mobile and remote operations.
features-binary-title = Single binary
features-binary-desc = Zero runtime dependencies. Just Rust. Currently verified on macOS; other operating systems are still under testing.
how-title = How it works
how-subtitle = App-layer brain orchestrates → Claw workforce executes → Results loop back for next decisions
how-step1-title = App layer plans with context
how-step1-desc = OpenClaw is the brain layer, combining Cursor CLI, skills, markdown playbooks, and channel context into structured requests.
how-step2-title = Claw Core executes as a workforce
how-step2-desc = Claw Core runs requests concurrently in isolated sessions, with unified stdout/stderr capture, timeout control, retries, and cleanup.
how-step3-title = Two-way loop keeps collaboration alive
how-step3-desc = Results flow back to OpenClaw for channel replies and next-step planning, then new tasks dispatch to Claw workers in a stable bidirectional loop.
setup-title = Skills and setup path
setup-subtitle = How this becomes real in production
setup-desc = OpenClaw and Claw Core work together as two layers: brain and runtime. This setup turns skills and markdown plans into reliable, concurrent execution with clear control loops.
setup-card1-title = Define skills and playbooks
setup-card1-desc = Write coding-agent skills and markdown playbooks for decision logic, constraints, and communication behavior.
setup-card2-title = Connect brain to runtime
setup-card2-desc = Let OpenClaw call Cursor CLI and dispatch structured requests to Claw Core workers through stable APIs.
setup-card3-title = Wire channels and feedback loops
setup-card3-desc = Connect Telegram, webhooks, and other channels so requests, progress, and responses can bounce across your workflow.
setup-card4-title = Operate with worker discipline
setup-card4-desc = Run concurrent sessions with isolation, timeout, retries, and cleanup, then feed results back to the brain for next decisions.
quickstart-title = Quick Start
quickstart-subtitle = One command installs the OpenClaw plugin (binary auto-downloads on first start)
quickstart-chip = One-liner
quickstart-os = macOS / Linux
quickstart-comment = Install the claw-core plugin. The daemon auto-downloads the binary from GitHub Releases when you run start (OpenClaw does not run npm postinstall).
quickstart-command = openclaw plugins install @wchklaus97hk/claw-core
quickstart-command-2 = openclaw clawcore start
quickstart-note-prefix = Docs: 
quickstart-note-docs = Documentation
quickstart-note-suffix =  — After install, run "openclaw clawcore start"; the daemon auto-downloads the binary and configures openclaw.json on first run.
quickstart-cursor-label = Cursor integration
quickstart-cursor-text = To use Cursor CLI with OpenClaw: run
quickstart-cursor-cmd = openclaw clawcore setup-cursor
quickstart-cursor-then = , then
quickstart-cursor-restart = openclaw gateway restart
quickstart-cursor-docs = See docs for steps and dependencies.
pricing-title = Pricing
pricing-pill = Open Source
pricing-price = Free
pricing-label = Claw Core is free (MIT). Cursor plan and model usage are separate.
pricing-li1 = Full API access
pricing-li2 = OpenClaw plugin
pricing-li3 = "Unlimited" depends on your Cursor plan

faq-title = FAQ
faq-subtitle = Common questions about Claw Core
faq1-q = What is Claw Core?
faq1-a = Claw Core is a Rust daemon that sits between AI agents (like OpenClaw) and the OS. Instead of agents calling exec directly, they talk to Claw Core via JSON over a Unix socket. It manages terminal sessions, runs commands with timeouts, and returns structured output.
faq2-q = How does it work with OpenClaw?
faq2-a-prefix = Install the claw-core plugin with 
faq2-a-suffix = . The plugin auto-starts the daemon when the gateway starts and provides skills for exec, sessions, and daemon management. Coding-agent skills still define behavior; Claw Core handles execution runtime.
faq3-q = Is it really free?
faq3-a = Claw Core itself is free and MIT licensed. Cursor plan usage and model API cost are separate, and "unlimited" depends on your Cursor plan.
faq4-q = How is this different from coding-agent skills?
faq4-a = Skills define behavior, prompts, and playbooks. Claw Core is runtime infrastructure: isolated sessions, timeouts, retries, process control, and structured execution output.
faq5-q = Can Claw Core run many workers concurrently?
faq5-a = Yes. It is built for parallel sessions and long-running worker pools, so multiple tasks can execute concurrently with stable isolation and cleanup.
faq6-q = How are secrets and execution safety handled?
faq6-a = Secrets are passed via environment variables to child processes and should remain in your own environment management. Claw Core enforces timeout and cleanup policies to reduce runaway execution risk.
faq7-q = Cloud-only or self-hosted: which is better?
faq7-a = Most teams use a hybrid approach: OpenClaw handles channels and orchestration, while Claw Core runs self-hosted workers for predictable control, better observability, and easier cost management.
cta-title = Ready to try?
cta-desc = Install the OpenClaw plugin or run the binary directly. See the docs for quick start.
